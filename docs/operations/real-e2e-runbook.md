# Real Discord E2E and isolated hosting

## Fixed test assets

These assets are test-only and must never be reused for real meetings or other
projects.

| Asset | Discord ID |
| --- | --- |
| Guild `Meeting Assistant E2E` | `1533228590643155034` |
| Voice channel `e2e-meeting` | `1533228823045214398` |
| Results channel `e2e-results` | `1533228891827736657` |
| Application `Meeting E2E SUT` | `1533224474609057793` |
| Application `Meeting E2E Speaker A` | `1533227577286852649` |
| Application `Meeting E2E Speaker B` | `1533228054724346087` |

Bot tokens are stored only in the local macOS Keychain service
`discord-voice-bot-e2e`, under accounts `sut`, `speaker-a`, and `speaker-b`.
They must not be copied into repository files, process arguments, logs, images,
or committed environment files.

## Hosting boundary

The deployment target is reached with:

```text
ssh codex-workers-eu-01
```

Before any deployment, inspect the host read-only and choose a new dedicated
directory, Compose project name, network, volumes, database role/database,
Redis namespace, ports, service account, and log path. Never open, run, restart,
or modify runtimes belonging to another project. The deployment must be
removable without addressing any shared project resource.

Secrets must be provisioned through the host's existing secret mechanism or a
new permission-restricted deployment environment file outside the checkout.
Never print them during provisioning or health checks.

## Required proof

Local deterministic and disposable-container tests are the default gate. A real
Discord run is a separate external gate and must exercise at least:

1. sequential Russian speech with English technical terms;
2. overlapping Speaker A and Speaker B speech;
3. actor disconnect and reconnect;
4. repeated post-call processing and publishing;
5. a second independent meeting to prove state isolation.

Each run must retain non-secret evidence: meeting and recording IDs, stage
transitions, audio duration, speaker IDs, transcript WER/CER and terminology
checks, overlap assertions, evidence-reference validation, and the final Discord
thread/message IDs. The acceptance result is invalid if any decision or action
item references a missing transcript turn, or if a retry creates a duplicate
meeting, summary, thread, or message.

Synthetic fixtures may be generated for deterministic speech. They must contain
only invented test content, identify the expected Discord speaker explicitly in
fixture metadata, and be checked with `ffprobe` before use. Provider/network
failures block only their external gate; work continues on local, integration,
recovery, documentation, or deployment-isolation checks.
